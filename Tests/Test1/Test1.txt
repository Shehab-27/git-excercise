✅ Exercise: Word Frequency Counter
✳️ Task:
Write a function called WordCount(s string) map[string]int that takes a string and returns a map where the keys are words and the values are how many times each word appears.

✳️ Requirements:
Words are separated by spaces.

The function should be case-insensitive (i.e., "Go" and "go" are the same word).

Ignore punctuation (you can define punctuation as: , . ! ?).

✳️ Example:
input := "Go go go! Time to Go, now."

result := WordCount(input)

fmt.Println(result)


✅ Expected Output:
map[string]int{
    "go":   4,
    "time": 1,
    "to":   1,
    "now":  1,
}
